# Common problems

## linear search or computation

often an array, list or collection. problem patterns like find max, min, basic sorting, basic statistics like average, sum.

- for loop and related (foreach, for of...)
  - nested for loop (i & j), common sorting
- while loop
- iteration pattern (while (!done) {current=next();} )

### sorted array

if the array is sorted, lots of algorithms works on sorted array like binary search.

### permutations and combinations

[1,2,3] => 123,132,213,231,312,321

get 2 items from [1,2,3] => [1,2],[1,3],[2,3]

### get subset of an array

### partition an array

like dutch flag, common problems like kth largest

### stack

array is fixed, stack and queue are dynamic which work well with while loop

### queue

## hashtable / map / dictionary / symbol table

grouping values to keys, i.e., count word occurences, pivot information by year/quarter/month

## set

has the union, intersect, except operations

## linked nodes and list

### tail

### head tail and cycle

## tree

## graph

## text
