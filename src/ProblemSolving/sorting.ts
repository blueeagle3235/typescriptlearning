// merge sort
// Merge sort is normally faster than shell sort, but shell sort is in place. Quick sort is faster if sorting data, but merge sort is usually faster if sorting an array of pointers or indices to data, if the compare overhead for the elements is greater than the move overhead for pointers or indices, since merge sort uses fewer compares but more moves than quick sort. If sorting an array of somewhat random integers, then counting / radix sort is fastest.
